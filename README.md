# Project
----------------------------------------------------
<b><ul>During first use:</ul></b>

First you need to have installed node.js and npm to your pc from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>  
After that, download the project to your disk.  
Navigate to project folder and open a cmd command prompt (or terminal).  
Enter the command <code>npm install</code> to install the necessary packages and dependencies.

<b><u>To run the project:</u></b>

Enter <code>npm run server</code>. That's it, the program will automatically open in your browser.   

<b><u>To add to the project:</u></b>

After each change in the code, you need to run <code>npm run build</code> for the project to install the changes.  
Alternatively you can run <code>npm run watch</code> which will automatically build any new changes each time you save any file.
Having server open with <code>npm run server</code> whilst doing changes has the same functionality.
