# Project
----------------------------------------------------
During first use:

First you need to have installed node.js and npm to your pc from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>  
After that, download the project to your disk.  
Navigate to project folder and open a cmd command prompt (or terminal).  
Enter the command <code>npm install</code> to install the necessary packages and dependencies.

To run the project:

Enter <code>npm run server</code>. That's it, the program will automatically open in your browser.   

To add to the project:

After each change in the code, you need to run <code>npm run build</code> for the project to install the changes.  
Alternatively you can run <code>npm run watch</code> which will automatically build any new changes each time you save any file.
Having server open with <code>npm run server</code> whilst doing changes has the same functionality.
